# DSA210 Term Project: Correlation Between Obesity and Socioeconomic Circumstances Based on Region of Turkey
## Project Overview
Over the years, due to many developments in biology, technology, agriculture and etc. human's body and health have been affected in bad way. Even though many research have been done, it seems that some of human beings are not sufficiently informed. One of the problems which humans are facing is obesity. 

My project is trying to find answers to
  - Does socioeconomic level of people have an impact on obesity? 
  - Does the region have impact on people who are facing obesity?
