# DSA210 Term Project: Correlation Between Obesity and Socioeconomic Status Based on Regions of Turkey
## Project Overview and Motivation 
Over the years, due to many developments in biology, technology, agriculture and etc. I think that human's body and health have been affected in bad way. Even though many research have been done, I have wondered that are human beings informed sufficiently. In my opinion, one of the problems which humans are facing is obesity. Additionaly, it seems to me that in different cities that I had visit, people's weight are changing due to their region and socioeconomic status.

My project is trying to find answers to
  - Does socioeconomic level of people have an impact on obesity? 
  - Does the region have impact on people who are facing obesity?

## Project Goal and Plan
I will create grades for socioeconomic levels based on regions, then I will make a correlation between socioeconomic level and obesity level. So that, I can see how are they correlated. Additionally, I will search the hypothesis that regions' impact on obesity with comparing the datas that I will be working on.

## Data Collection 
I will collect data from two different sources:
  1. **Obesity Percentages in Different Regions in Turkey:** From The Ministry of Health of Turkey
     - This sources gives the information of 12 different regions' obesity percentages who are the people older than 15 years old.
     - _https://hsgm.saglik.gov.tr/tr/obezite_
       
  2. **Socioeconomic Levels:** From The Ministry of Industry and Technology
     - This sources gives the information of all citys' townships' level of socioeconomic level in 6 levels.
     - I will give each city and region a grade, because the data is for township.

## Analysis Plan
1. **Data Collection**
   - Importing and calculating the level of socioeconomic grades into Excel records.
   - Importing the percentages of obesity in regions into Excel records.
   - Importing the Excel records into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocess the data.

2. **Visualization**
   - Visiualizing the datas as:
     - Correlation between region and socioeconomic status
     - Correlation between region and obesity
     - Correlation between region and obesity
     - Correlation between socioeconomic status and obesity
       
3. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Test hypotheses like:
     - Region which are nearby the sea has positive impact to people with not getting weight and become obese.
     - Socioeconomic status have positive impact to people with not getting weight and become obese.

4. **Trend Analysis**
   - Identifying peaks and plateus
   - Analyze how region and socioeconomic status are related to obesity.

## Technologies and Tools
**Python:** For data cleaning and statistical analysis
**Pandas:** To manipulate and preprocess data
Using ML
