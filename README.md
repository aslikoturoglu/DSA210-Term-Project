# DSA210 Term Project: Correlation Between Obesity and Socioeconomic Circumstances Based on Region of Turkey
## Project Overview
Over the years, due to many developments in biology, technology, agriculture and etc. I think that human's body and health have been affected in bad way. Even though many research have been done, I have wondered that are human beings informed sufficiently. In my opinion, one of the problems which humans are facing is obesity. Additionaly, it seems to me that in different cities that I had visit, people's weight are changing due to their region and socioeconomic circumstances.

My project is trying to find answers to
  - Does socioeconomic level of people have an impact on obesity? 
  - Does the region have impact on people who are facing obesity?

## Project Goal and Plan
I will create grades for socioeconomic levels based on regions, then I will make a correlation between socioeconomic level and obesity level. So that, I can see how are they correlated. Additionally, I will search the hypothesis that regions' impact on obesity with comparing the datas that I will be working on.

## Data Collection 
I will collect data from two different sources:
  1. **Obesity Percentages in Different Regions in Turkey:** From The Ministry of Health of Turkey
     - This sources gives the information of 12 different regions' obesity percentages who are the people older than 15 years old.
     - _https://hsgm.saglik.gov.tr/tr/obezite_
       
  2. **Socioeconomic Levels:** From The Ministry of Industry and Technology
     - This sources gives the information of all citys' townships' level of socioeconomic level in 6 levels.
     - I will give each city and region a grade, because the data is for township.
